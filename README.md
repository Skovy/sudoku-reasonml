## Run this project

```
yarn # install dependencies
yarn start # build and watch files
yarn webpack # in another tab 
```

After you see the webpack compilation succeed (the `yarn webpack` step), open up 
the nested html files in `docs/*` (**no server needed!**). Then modify whichever 
file in `src` and refresh the page to see the changes.
